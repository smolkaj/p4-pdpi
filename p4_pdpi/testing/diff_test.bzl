"""Blaze targets for golden file testing of the pdpi library.

This file defines targets `run_pdpi` and `diff_test`, which are intended to be
used in conjunction for "golden file testing" as follows:
```BUILD.bazel
    run_pdpi(
        name = "metadata",
        src = "testdata/metadata.pb.txt",
    )

    diff_test(
        name = "metadata_test",
        actual = ":metadata",
        expected = "testdata/metadata.expected"  # golden file
    )
```
The run_pdpi takes an input proto describing the different test cases, and
produces either the output or the error message of running on that test input.

The diff_test target then computes the diff of the `actual` output and the
`expected` output, either succeeding if the diff is empty or failing and
printing the nonempty diff otherwise. To auto-generate or update the expected
file, run:
```sh
    bazel run <diff test target> -- --update`
```
Make sure that the expected file exists.
